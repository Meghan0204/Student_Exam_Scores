# Student_Exam_Scores

I analyzed a Kaggle dataset using Jupyter Notebook to explore the relationship between student exam scores and factors like behavior and access to resources. Utilizing Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data cleaning and visualization, I found no strong correlations. However, weak to moderate correlations were observed between study time and class absences.
